Basic Todo App
This is a basic todo application built using React and TypeScript. The main goal of this project is to practice TypeScript concepts within a React application. The todo app allows users to add, remove tasks as completed.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the todo list.
Remove Tasks: Tasks can be removed from the todo list.

Goal
I created this project to better understand TypeScript with React. I haven't added any styling to this repository yet, but I plan to add some basic styles soon to enhance its appearance. However, my main focus is not on styling.
